# Exercise 1: Pushing to GitHub

For our first assignment, we'll be doing something basic. We'll clone a repository from GitHub, edit a single file, make a commit for that file and then push the changes back to GitHub. You'll be using GitHub to submit several of your assignments this semester, so it's important that you learn this process.

## Steps
1. Create a GitHub account. Use your Rutgers .edu email to do this in order to get some free goodies. Then, use the link on Sakai to join the assignment.
2. Grab a free text editor such as Atom, Visual Studio Code or Sublime.
3. Download and install GitHub Desktop and log in.
4. Clone the repository onto your computer.
5. Edit the "Hello World" HTML file, replacing [your name] with your actual name.
6. Commit the changes with a commit message that describes what you've done and then push the repository back to GitHub.
